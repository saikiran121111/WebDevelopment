let num = 2+2 // let is used to declare a variable at first in js which is different in other languages like java
//where in java  we use int a = 5; something like that
console.log(num)
num = 6 // here I'm not using the let because num is already declared I'm just using that to change the value
console.log(num)// you can rewrite the value of num aswell
console.log(num+3)
let username = "Ruku"
let userid = 'Ruku' // string can be kept either in single quotes or in double quotes
console.log(username,userid)
