let num = 2+2 // let is used to declare a variable at first in js which is different in other languages like java
//where in java  we use int a = 5; something like that
console.log(num)
num = 6 // here I'm not using the let because num is already declared I'm just using that to change the value
console.log(num)// you can rewrite the value of num aswell
console.log(num+3)
let username = "Ruku"
let $user_id = 'Ruku' // string can be kept either in single quotes or in double quotes
//dollar and underscore are the only symbols that are allowed in js
console.log(username,$user_id)

let r = 45
const pi = 3.14
const area = pi * r * r// here const are constants where if I want to change the value of variable it can't be changed
console.log(area)
